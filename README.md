# ScribbleSolver-Equation-Solver-Model

Project Overview

The Handwritten Equation Solver is a machine learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to recognize and interpret handwritten mathematical equations. This project has resulted in a model that accurately identifies digits and mathematical symbols from handwritten input, effectively translating these into solvable equations.

Our model is highly accurate with a measured accuracy of 98.27%, and a minimized loss function of 0.656%. This showcases the successful application of machine learning techniques to solve complex, real-world problems.
