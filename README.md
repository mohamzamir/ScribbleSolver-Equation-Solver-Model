# ScribbleSolver-Equation-Solver-Model

## Introduction

◦ Collaborated on the development of a Handwritten Equation Solver, an advanced system powered by Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) for the recognition of digits and symbols, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for image
processing and segmentation. <br>
◦ Built a versatile model capable of interpreting and solving equations of any degree (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.), with a
specific focus on equations containing the variable ’x’, demonstrating the effective application of machine learning to
handwritten input. <br>
◦ Through meticulous training and tuning, achieved a high model accuracy of 98.27% and a minimal loss function of 0.656,
indicating successful recognition and solution of handwritten equations

## How to use?
◦ Import the ipynb file and upload it in JupyterBook or Google Colab. <br>
◦ Run all the cells.
